Our new lab website was designed by [Ben Lindsay](/members/ben-lindsay/)
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator.
The framework was heavily inspired by
[Trevor Bedford's website](http://bedford.io/),
who kindly made his source code publicly available
and [invited anyone to use it](http://bedford.io/misc/about/).
