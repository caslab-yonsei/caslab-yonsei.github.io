title: RSoft
description: RSoft is a set of C++ and Python code developed by the Riggleman lab to (a) evaluate Parrinello-like structure functions, (b) train softness hyperplanes, (c) store structure functions and hyperplanes in a standardized format, and (d) evaluate softness fields as in Cubuk et. al. PRL (2015). The focus of the library is generalizability, ease of use, and efficiency in computation.
