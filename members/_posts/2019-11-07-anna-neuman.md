Hi, I'm Anna! I am a  PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department, coadvised by [Daeyeon Lee](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~leegroup/people.html). I use polymer field theory and molecular dynamics to understand the impacts of confinement and polymer-nanoparticle interactions on the thermodynamics of highly-filled polymer blend nanocomposites. I work closely with experimentalists in the Lee Lab creating composites with the Capillary Rise Infiltration (CaRI) method. 

Prior to my PhD I earned a B.S. in Chemical-Biological Engineering from MIT, where I worked in the lab of Daniel Anderson, optimizing nanoparticle platforms for the delivery of mRNA.
