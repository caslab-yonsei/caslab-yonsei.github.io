I am a first year PhD student in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. While I do not currently have a project, I am planning to do work with simulations. I received my bachelor's degree with honors from The Pennsylvania State University (Penn State). My honors thesis project was the development of a novel technique for simulating the osmotic pressure of ionic solutions alongside Dr. Scott Milner. This project is what made me interested in molecular simulations, as well as continue to develop my knowledge in that area into a PhD.
