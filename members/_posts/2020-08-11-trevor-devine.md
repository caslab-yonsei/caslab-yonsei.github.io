I am a first-year PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular department and am co-advised by Prof. Daeyeon Lee. I explore the effect of extreme nanoconfinement on the thermodynamics and transport phenomena in multiphasic nanocomposite films through experimental methods. I received my bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. My undergraduate research was focused on process intensification for the production of polymeric dispersants with Dr. Götz Veser, but I eventually grew interested in studying soft matter through a more fundamental lens.  I believe that research into this field will be the key to engineering a modern and sustainable future.
