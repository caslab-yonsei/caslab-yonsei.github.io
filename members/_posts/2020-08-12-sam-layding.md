Hey! My name is Sam, and I'm a Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering PhD student in the Riggleman Group. My work is centered on understanding the transport phenomena of small molecules through glassy materials. I believe that highly specialized materials for separation processes and membrane applications will play a critical role in sustainable development over the next several decades, and I seek to understand how they can be engineered effectively. When I'm not in the lab, you can usually find me outside running, playing with my dog, gardening, doing community organizing work here in Philly, or watching movies. Some of my other research interests include carbon capture and storage, which was the focus of my work with Dr. Hugo Caram at Lehigh University where I earned my B.S. '19 and M.S. '20 in CBE.
