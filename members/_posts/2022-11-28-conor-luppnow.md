Hi, I'm Conor. I am a first year PhD student in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, co-advised by John Crocker. I study and model energy landscapes of different systems. Generally these are glassy systems.
I completed my undergraduate degree at Rutgers University. There I worked with Dr. Chiew, and used molecular dynamics to study the Widom Line in dodecane nitrogen mixtures. I also simulated nitrogen permeability through 3D nanoporous graphene oxide membranes.
