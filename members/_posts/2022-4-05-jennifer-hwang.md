I am a PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at UPenn. I work with [Dr. Crocker](http://crocker.seas.upenn.edu/) and Dr. Riggleman to perform computational modeling of foam dynamics using the programming language C. My research is specifically interested in studying the viscoelastic behavior of many soft glassy matter.

I received my bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the [University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/).
