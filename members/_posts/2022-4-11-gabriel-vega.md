Hiya, my name is Gabriel and I'm a Materials Science and Engineering student in the Riggleman Group. My work is centered on reproducing experimentally observed self-assembled polymer systems using molecular dynamics simulations. I am mostly interested in computational materials design and discovery as I believe that leveraging computational resources greatly expedites the process of creating new unique and useful materials. Outside of lab work I like to be near trees or some sort of body of water (when it isn't too cold), reading books, or spending quality time with friends. I love meeting people from different cultures and learning things about them so I'd like to travel the world, but eventually go back to my island home of Puerto Rico to enjoy my old age in relative peace (if the hurricanes allow it).
