Hi, my name is Dongqi, from Hebei, China. I am a PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. I received my Bachelor Degree in Chemical Engineering from Tianjin University. My undergraduate research was focused on micro-particles fluidization, supervised by Dr. Jesse Zhu. I have done some other reseaches about catalysis, microfluidics, polymers and eventually developed a interest in polymers and molecular simulation.
