Hi, my name is Zuzanna! I am a PhD student in the department of Physics and Astronomy. My research focuses on soft matter physics, bio-materials, computational physics, and polymer field theory. I received my Bachelor's Degree in Physics from RPI in August 2021. My CV can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17818XVWOjbnunmRPGvfoMDvJY9qJo_Rb/view?usp=sharing).
