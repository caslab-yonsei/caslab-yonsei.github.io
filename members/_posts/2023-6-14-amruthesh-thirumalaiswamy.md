I'm a Ph.D. student in the department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, co-advised by Prof. [John Crocker](https://crocker.seas.upenn.edu). I'm studying the physics of soft glassy systems, and developing tools and models to explore the energy landscape of these systems.

I completed my undergraduate major in Chemical Engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/), with a minor in Physics.
