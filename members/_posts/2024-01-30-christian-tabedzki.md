Hi, my name is Chris. I am a fifth-year PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular engineering department.

I received my BS in Chemical Engineering from [Rutgers University](http://cbe.rutgers.edu). I developed an interest in polymers as a research assistant for [Masanori Hara](http://soe.rutgers.edu/hara-masanori).
