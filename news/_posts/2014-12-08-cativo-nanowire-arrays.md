The ability to control the molecular packing and nanoscale morphology of conjugated polymers is important for many of their applications. Here, we report the fabrication of well-ordered nanoarrays of conjugated polymers, based on the self-assembly of conjugated block copolymers at the air-liquid interface. We demonstrate that the self-assembly of poly(3-hexylthiophene)-*block*-poly(ethylene glycol) (P3HT-*b*-PEG) at the air-water interface leads to large-area free-standing films of well-aligned P3HT nanowires. Block copolymers with high P3HT contents (82-91%) formed well-ordered nanoarrays at the interface. The fluidic nature of the interface, block copolymer architecture, and rigid nature of P3HT were necessary for the formation of well-ordered nanostructures. The free-standing films formed at the interface can be readily transferred to arbitrary solid substrates. The P3HT-*b*-PEG films are integrated in field-effect transistors and show orders of magnitude higher charge carrier mobility than spin-cast films, demonstrating that the air-liquid interfacial self-assembly is an effective thin film fabrication tool for conjugated block copolymers.
