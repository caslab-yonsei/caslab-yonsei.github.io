A modeling framework is developed to describe the structure and properties of fluid interfaces stabilized with grafted nanoparticles. The framework is demonstrated on nanoparticles functionalized with polymers of various grafting architectures; we find that the conformation of the grafted chains plays an important role in the interfacial tension.
