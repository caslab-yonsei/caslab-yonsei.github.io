Interfacial interactions can play an important role in the glass transition
temperature ($$ T_g $$) and relaxation dynamics of ultra-thin glass
polymer films. We have recently shown that similar to the polymeric systems in
ultra-thin molecular glass films of $$ N, N' $$-Bis(3-methylphenyl)-$$ N, N' $$ -diphenylbenzidine (TPD), the $$ T_g $$ is reduced and dynamics are enhanced. Furthermore, in molecular
glass systems, as the film thickness is reduced below $$ \sim $$ 30 nm,
the dynamics at the two interfaces correlate such that the range of the
gradients in the dynamics induced by the free surface narrows compared to
thicker films. These observations indicate that the dynamics of the glassy thin
films are strongly correlated and cannot be explained by a simple two-layer
model consisting of a bulk and a thin interfacial layer with a constant
thickness and constant range of dynamical gradients. Here, we investigate the
effect of film/substrate interactions on the film dynamics by varying the
TPD/substrate interfacial interactions. We show that thin TPD films with
thicknesses below $$ \sim $$60 nm show a smaller extent of $$ T_g $$ reduction and enhanced dynamics when supported on a
near-neutral substrate (wetting) compared to a weakly interacting (dewetting)
substrate. However, the $$ \sim $$30 nm length scale, where the
activation energy significantly reduces from its bulk value as measured by the
onset of the glass transition remains unchanged. Coarse-grained molecular
dynamics simulation also shows a narrowing in the range of relaxation times once
the thickness is sufficiently reduced for the two interfaces to dynamically
correlate, consistent with previous work. These results suggest that the
length-scale for the correlated dynamics is independent of interfacial
interactions and the polymeric nature of the film and may originate from the
bulk glass properties.
