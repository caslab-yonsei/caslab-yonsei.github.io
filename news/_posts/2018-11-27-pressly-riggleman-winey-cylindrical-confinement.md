The behavior of polymer melts under cylindrical confinement was investigated
using molecular dynamics simulations. A range of polymer chains, from
unentangled to highly entangled, were confined in cylindrical pores with radii
ranging from much smaller to much larger than the polymer size. These
simulations were used to measure polymer chain conformation, entanglement
density, and center-of-mass diffusion. The conformational anisotropy is
well-described by a confined random walk model, although excluded volume effects
cause slight differences in the radius of gyration. The number of entanglements
per chain in confinement is accurately described using a simple volume fraction
model consisting of a zero-entanglement region near the pore wall and a bulklike
entanglement region in the pore center. The size of the depletion region near
the wall is chain length dependent. Finally, the diffusion along the pore axis
exhibits nonmonotonic behavior with the pore radius. As the pore radius
decreases, the diffusion coefficient, $$ D $$, initially increases due to increasing
chain disentanglement, though for small pores $$ D $$ eventually decreases as a result
of confinement-induced chain segregation.
