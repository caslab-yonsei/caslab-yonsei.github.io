We explore the relationship between a machine-learned structural quantity (softness) and excess entropy in simulations of supercooled liquids. Excess entropy is known to scale well the dynamical properties of liquids, but this quasi-universal scaling is known to breakdown in supercooled and glassy regimes. Using numerical simulations, we test whether a local form of the excess entropy can lead to predictions similar to those made by softness, such as the strong correlation with particlesâ€™ tendency to rearrange. In addition, we explore leveraging softness to compute excess entropy in the traditional fashion over softness groupings. Our results show that the excess entropy computed over softness-binned groupings is correlated with activation barriers to rearrangement.
