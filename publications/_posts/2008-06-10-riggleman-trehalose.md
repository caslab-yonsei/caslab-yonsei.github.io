We have performed molecular dynamics simulations of glassy trehalose with various amounts of glycerol in order to explore the tendency for glycerol to antiplasticize the glass. We find that below a temperature of 300*K*, the average density of the system containing 5%<sub>wt</sub> glycerol is larger than that of the pure trehalose system; the glass transition temperature is decreased, and the elastic constants are essentially unchanged. Taken together, these phenomena are indicative of mild antiplasticization, a type of behavior generally observed in polymeric systems. We have calculated the local elastic constants in our glassy materials and, consistent with previous simulations on a coarse-grained polymer, we find evidence of domains having negative elastic moduli. We have explored the ability of various measures of the Debye–Waller factor ⟨*u*<sup>2</sup>⟩ to predict the stiffness of our systems in terms of their elastic constants. We find that ⟨*u*<sup>2</sup>⟩ is indeed correlated with the behavior of the bulk elastic constants. On a local level, a correlation exists between the local moduli and ⟨*u*<sup>2</sup>⟩; however, that correlation is not strong enough to arrive at conclusive statements about the local elastic properties.
