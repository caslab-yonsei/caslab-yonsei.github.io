We study the effect of physical confinement on the capillary infiltration of
polymers into cylindrical nanopores using molecular dynamics simulations. In
particular, we probe whether the critical contact angle ($$ \theta_c $$) above which
capillary rise infiltration ceases to occur changes for long-chain polymers,
possibly due to loss of conformation entropy induced by chain confinement.
Surprisingly, $$ \theta_c $$ does not strongly depend on the length of polymer
chains and stays constant for large $$ N $$. A free energy model is developed to
show that $$ \theta_c $$ depends strongly on the size of statistical segments rather
than $$ N $$, which we confirm by performing MD simulations of infiltration with
semiflexible polymers. These results could provide guidelines in manufacturing
polymer nanostructures and nanocomposites using capillary rise infiltration.
