Although many studies have analyzed the behavior of polymers under 1-D thin film
and 2-D cylindrical confinement, the knowledge about how confinement geometries
with more than one length scale, such as random porous networks, impact polymers
is yet to be fully explored. We simulate both entangled and unentangled polymer
melts confined in a diamond network geometry with two characteristic length
scales, where polymers are likely to inhabit multiple interconnected and
neighboring channels. In all the confined systems with entangled polymer chains,
the polymer radius of gyration and the number of polymer entanglements per chain
are reduced compared to the bulk. We analyze the chain relaxation based on Rouse
modes and show separate, competing effects between the local friction near the
wall and chain disentanglement. The disentanglement of confined polymers
increases diffusivity of entangled polymers along confined channels compared to
the bulk after the confined diffusivities are corrected for the tortuosity of
the confinement. We anticipate that the corrections due to tortuosity could be
important for properly characterizing the dynamics in complex geometries,
including highly loaded nanocomposites.
