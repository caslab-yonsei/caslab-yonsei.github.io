Block copolymer matrices are often used to control nanoparticle (NP) dispersion
behavior, but the effects of diblock domain interfaces on particle–particle
interactions have not been well characterized. In this paper, polymer field
theoretic simulations are used to quantify interactions between both bare and
grafted spherical NPs in microphase-separated A–B diblock copolymers. It is
shown that for bare NPs that have an athermal interaction with and a diameter
similar to the B domain, the presence of an A–B interface leads to an effective
interaction between the particles with multiple minima separated by a free
energy barrier. It is further shown that these effects primarily result from
chain stretching and compression near the A–B interface induced by
particle–particle interactions as opposed to increases in A–B contact at the
interfaces. Grafted chains largely prevent these effects and reduce
particle–particle interaction strength. When confined by diblock domain
interfaces, grafted chains have a reduced extension compared to what is expected
for de-wetted brush chains, as commonly described in homopolymer results.
Finally, these studies indicate a new route toward linking spherical NPs in a
controlled fashion, allowing for tunable plasmonic properties in the case of
metallic NPs.
