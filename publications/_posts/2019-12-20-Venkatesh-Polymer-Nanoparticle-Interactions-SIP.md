Naturally occuring nanocomposites like nacre owe their exceptional mechanical
properties to high loadings of platelets that are bridged by small volume
fractions of polymers. Polymer infiltration into dense assemblies of
nanoparticles provides a powerful and potentially scalable approach to
manufacture bio-inspired nanocomposites that mimic nacreâ€™s architecture.
Solvent-driven infiltration of polymers (SIP) into nanoparticle packings formed
on top of glassy polymer films is induced via capillary condensation of a
solvent in the interstitial voids between nanoparticles (NP), followed by
plasticization and transport of polymers into the liquid-filled pores, leading
to the formation of the nanocomposite structure. To understand the effect of
polymer-nanoparticle interactions on the dynamics of polymer infiltration in
SIP, we perform molecular dynamics simulations. The mechanism of polymer
infiltration and the influence of interactions between polymer and NPs on the
dynamics of the process are investigated. Depending on the strength of
interaction, polymer infiltration either follows (a) dissolution-dominated
infiltration where plasticized polymer chains remain solvated in the pores and
rapidly diffuse into the packing or (b) adhesion-dominated transport where the
chains adsorb onto the nanoparticle surface and move slowly through the
nanoparticle film as a well-defined front. A non-monotonic trend emerges as the
adhesion strength is increased; the infiltration of chains becomes faster with
the co-operative effect of adhesion and dissolution as adhesion increases but
eventually slows down when the polymer-nanoparticle adhesion dominates.
