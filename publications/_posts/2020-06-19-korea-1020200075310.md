According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a system for providing integrated security includes: a terminal including a first security unit; a server including a second security unit; and a communication interface which supports communication between the first security unit and the second security unit to create an encrypted communication channel between a processor of the terminal and a processor of a server to form an integrated security environment through them, wherein the first security unit and the second security unit use the different processors. Accordingly, it is possible to safely protect and process user's authentication information, personalization information, user's financial information, vehicle usage information, and the like.
