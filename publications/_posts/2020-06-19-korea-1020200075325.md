Disclosed are an electronic device and a power management method of the electronic device. The power management method of the electronic device comprises: a step of driving a processor of the electronic device in normal power mode; a step of receiving a data packet from an external device; a step of processing the received data packet as polling; a step of obtaining a first number of processed packets of data packets processed by polling when a network interrupt occurs; and a step of converting a normal power mode to a network intensive power mode when the first number of processed packets exceeds a first threshold value. Therefore, the present invention is capable of improving a power efficiency.
