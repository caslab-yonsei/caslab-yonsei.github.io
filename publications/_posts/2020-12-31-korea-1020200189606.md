Disclosed are an electronic device for controlling an interrupt generation rate based on a transmission queue and a control method of the electronic device. The electronic device according to the present disclosure receives an input/output request from an external device, enables an interrupt indicating a completion of an operation to be generated when the operation according to the input/output request is completed, and transmits an input/output response for a phase input/output request to the external device. Specifically, the electronic device controls a generation rate of the interrupt to a first rate, identifies a length of a transmission queue for transmitting an input/output response to the external device, and enables the generation rate of the interrupt to be changed to a second rate faster than that of the first rate when the length of the transmission queue exceeds a predetermined threshold length.
