A wide range of soft amorphous solids, such as coarsening foams and emulsions, pastes, and even living cells, have anomalous rheological properties where the modulus exhibits a weak power-law behavior, $$G^\ast (\omega) \sim \omega^{\beta}$$  with $$\beta$$ a non-trivial exponent typically in the range $$0.1 < \beta < 0.3$$. While phenomenological models have been developed to describe this class of behavior known as soft glassy rheology, there had not been any particle-level models that exhibit this weak power law behavior. To that end, along with [John Crocker](http://crocker.seas.upenn.edu/) ([Penn, Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering](http://www.cbe.seas.upenn.edu/)), we have developed a novel model where soft glassy rheology is emergent. Our model consists of a polydisperse collection of soft spheres (bubbles) that represent a coarsening foam. Gas flows from the small bubbles to the large bubbles driven by Laplace pressure differences between the bubbles, and our simulations proceed by following a quasi-static ripening process. We allow a small amount of ripening, subsequently quench the system to an energy minimum, and repeat. Interestingly, we find that the dynamics of the bubbles is super diffusive at long times where $$\left< r^2 \right> \sim t^{\alpha}$$, with $$\alpha = 1.37$$. By analyzing the stress fluctuations and using analysis from the microrheology community, we are able to connect these dynamics to the SGR power law rheology behavior to find that our model predicts $$\beta = 0.17$$. To understand the origin of this behavior, we tracked the dynamics of the system along its 3N-dimensional energy landscape, and we found that the trajectories have the properties of a self-similar fractal and the dimensionality of the fractal can be directly related to the power law exponent $$\beta$$. Our work provides a deep connection between the dynamics of these systems on a gradually evolving energy landscape and their rheological properties.
